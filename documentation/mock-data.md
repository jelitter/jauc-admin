# Mock server

### Dependencies
To run the mock-server setup, you'll need to install _json-server_.

```
 > $ npm install --save-dev json-server
```

### Mock folder
The /mock/ folder contains a collection of JSON files that the server will pass on to a request.

### Run mock server
To run the mock server, a script has been added to [package.json](../package.json)
```
    "mock": "json-serverâ€Šâ€”-watch mock/data.json"
```

When you run the following command, the server will start serving the JSON on http://localhost:3000/motd
```
 > $ npm run mock
```

However, that is usually not quite as helpful as we need to tell Angular to check this path.
Therefore, another npm command can start up both at the same time.
```
 > $ npm run serve:mock
```
